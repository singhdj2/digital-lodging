# Phenomics-Enabled-Digital-Lodging
R scripts and supporting data for phenomics enabled genetic dissection of lodging in wheat. 

## Introduction
This repository contains scripts and supporting data neccessary to reproducing my work with digital quantification of lodging through unmanned aerial systems (UAS) or drone based phenotyping in wheat. This work is currently under consideration as a journal manuscript, and is part of my PhD dissertation at Kansas State University (Jesse Poland Lab). The raw data associated with this project can be accessed here: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6151127. I'm currently cleaning up some of the scripts so it will be made available in batches. Following are the project updates:

- 10/26/2018: Added function to estimate plot-level mixture normal parameters from digital elevation models.
